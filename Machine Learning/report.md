[Matplotlib](https://www.activestate.com/blog/plotting-data-in-python-matplotlib-vs-plotly/) is an interactive, cross-platform library for two-dimensional plotting. It can produce high-quality graphs, charts and plots in several hardcopy formats.

**Advantages:**

*   Flexible usage: supports both Python and IPython shells, Python scripts, Jupyter Notebook, web application servers and many GUI toolkits (GTK+, Tkinter, Qt, and wxPython).
*   Optionally provides a MATLAB-like interface for simple plotting.
*   The object-oriented interface gives complete control of axes properties, font properties, line styles, etc.
*   Compatible with several graphics backends and operating systems.
*   Matplotlib is frequently incorporated in other libraries, such as Pandas.

Matplotlib is a visualization library, not a data analysis library. For data analysis, youâ€™ll need to combine it with other libraries, like Pandas.

[Pandas](https://www.activestate.com/blog/how-to-clean-machine-learning-datasets-using-pandas/) is a Python library for providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language.

**Advantages:**

*   Expressive, fast, and flexible data structures.
*   Supports aggregations, concatenations, iteration, re-indexing, and visualizations operations.
*   Very flexible usage in conjunction with other Python libraries.
*   Intuitive data manipulation using minimal commands.
*   Supports a wide range of commercial and academic domains.
*   Optimized for performance.

**Disadvantages:**

*   It is built on matplotlib, meaning a novice programmer has to be familiar with both libraries in order to know which one would be best suited to solve their problem.

The Python library, [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/), is built on top of the matplotlib, NumPy, and SciPy libraries. This Python ML library has several tools for data analysis and data mining tasks.

**Advantages**:

*   Simple, easy to use, and effective.
*   In rapid development, and constantly being improved.
*   Wide range of algorithms, including clustering, factor analysis, principal component analysis, and more.
*   Can extract data from images and text.
*   Can be used for NLP.
