**R Basics**

## Basic R

R **syntax** looks a bit different to Python. Many people think it's not as clean. But the fundamental **concepts** are mostly the same: line-by-line execution, primitive data types, compound data types, assignment, function calls, iteration and conditionals, classes.

## Numerical data

```{r}
x <- 5 
typeof(x) # vector of length 1 of type double!
x <- 5L   
typeof(x) # using 'L', a vector of length 1 of type int
```

## 
```{r}
s <- "abcdefghi" # assignment using "<-"
x <- 5
while (x > 0) { # curly brackets
  if (x %% 2 == 0) { # operators may differ from Python
    print(c(x, substr(s, x, x))) # c() means concatenate
  }
  x = x - 1 # assignment using "="
}
```

## Special values

* `NA`: not applicable/missing (common in data read from e.g. CSV files)
* `NaN`: "not a number", as in Python
* `-Inf`, `Inf`: infinite values, as in Python

```{r}
c(NA, c(-1, 0, 1) / 0)
```

&nbsp;

### Special functions

`is.finite()`, `is.infinite()`, `is.na()`, `is.nan()`



## What's this about `<-` and `=`?

They usually do the same thing -- assignment -- but there are a few places where `=` is not allowed. The R community tends to stick to `<-`.

## Factors

A *factor* is a primitive datatype for categorical data. It's especially useful in statistical formulae.
```{r}
x <- factor(c("cat", "dog", "cat"), 
            levels=c("mouse", "cat", "dog"))
typeof(x) # integer?! yes, behind the scenes
length(x)
```


## Vectors: a compound data type

```{r}
x <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
x[1] # BTW R indexes from 1, not from 0
x[[1]]
```

## What's the difference between `[]` and `[[]]`?

Both exist and sometimes do the same thing, sometimes different! 

```{r}
x <- c("one", "two", "three", "four", "five")
x[1] # BTW R indexes from 1, not from 0
x[[1]]
```

```{r}
x[c(3, 2, 5)] # single [] for selecting a subset of elements
# x[[c(3, 2, 5)]] # double [[]] doesn't work here
```

## Lists with named elements

A `list` with named elements is a bit like a `dict`:

```{r}
a <- list(a = 1:3, b = "a string", c = pi, d = list(-1, -5))
a[["b"]] # double square brackets
```

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

`$` is the same as `[[]]` but only for named elements:

```{r}
a$b # notice, no quotation marks
```


## List subsetting

```{r}
a <- list(a = 1:3, b = "a string", c = pi, d = list(-1, -5))
```

## Compound data types

* R `vector` -> Python `list` or Numpy `ndarray`
* R `list` -> Python `tuple`
* R `data.frame` -> Pandas `DataFrame`
* R `tibble` -> Pandas `DataFrame`


## Inspecting compound data types

The `str` function gives you the *structure* of an item:

```{r}
str(a)
```

&nbsp;

The `typeof` and `length` functions are self-explanatory:

```{r}
typeof(a)
length(a)
```


## Ranges, columns, `for-in`

```{r}
xs = 1:10 # range 1, 2, ... 10
print(xs)
for (x in xs) {
  print(x^2 %% 2)
}
```


## But don't use for-loops!

R is vectorised, like Numpy:

```{r}
xs = 1:10
xs = xs ^ 2
ys = xs %% 2
ys
```

## Vectorised if-else


```{r}
v1 = 1:5
v2 = v1 ^ 2
v3 = ifelse(v2 %% 2 == 0, "Even", "Odd")
v3
```

Compare to Numpy `np.where`.


## Recycling

```{r}
1:10 * 1:2
```

The shorter vector is recycled. But this is ugly: don't use it!


## Functions

`function` is the equivalent of Python `lambda`.

```{r}
normalise <- function(x) {
  # no "return" statement: last value is returned
  (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)) 
}
normalise(1:10)
```


## Exercises

1. Write the Factorial function in R, eg `fact(5)` gives `120`.
2. Given `x <- "John"`, calculate the length in characters of `x`. Use `nchar()`.
3. Given `xs <- c("John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo")`,
   calculate the length of each name, using vectorisation (not a for-loop).
4. Calculate whether each name is shorter than 5 characters.
5. Index `xs` to keep just the names shorter than 5 characters.
6. Write a function which unit-norms a vector, ie normalises it so that the vector length equals 1.
   Eg `unit_norm(c(10, 10, 10, 10))` gives `0.5 0.5 0.5 0.5`.
7. Write a function which standardises a vector, ie gets the $z$-score, ie maps it to have mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
   Eg `z_score(c(10, 6, 12, 12))` gives `0.0000000 -1.4142136  0.7071068  0.7071068`.


## Solutions

```{r}
fact <- function(n) { # Exercise 1
  if (n <= 1) {
    1 # remember, no return statement!
  } else {
    n * fact(n-1)
  }
}
fact(5)
```

***

```{r}
x <- "John"
nchar(x) # Exercise 2
xs <- c("John", "Paul", "George", "Ringo")
nchar(xs) # Exercise 3
nchar(xs) < 5 # Exercise 4
xs[nchar(xs) < 5] # Exercise 5
```

*** 

```{r}
unit_norm <- function(x) { # Exercise 6
  x / sqrt(sum(x**2))
}
unit_norm(c(10, 10, 10, 10))
```
  
```{r}
z_score <- function(x) { # Exercise 7
  (x - mean(x)) / sd(x)
}
z_score(c(10, 6, 12, 12))
```
