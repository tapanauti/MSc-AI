`dplyr`





## `dplyr`

`dplyr` is a package for relational operations on data. That is, it does stuff similar to `SQL`, which many students will be familiar with (also comparable to Excel and Pandas). In particular:

* `filter` (choose rows, like SQL `where`)
* `arrange` (sort rows)
* `select` (choose columns, like SQL `select`)
* `mutate` (add columns)
* `summarise` (condense multiple values)
* `sample_n`, `sample_frac` (for taking a quick look at a sub-sample, see also `head`)
* `inner_join`, `left_join`, `right_join`, `full_join` (join two tables, like SQL `join`)


## `dplyr` and the pipe operator

All the `dplyr` verbs (`select`, etc.) have three things in common (from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html):

&nbsp;

1. The first argument is a data frame [actually, a tibble].
2. The subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame. You can refer to columns in the data frame directly without using $.
3. The result is a new data frame 

&nbsp;

Therefore, it is natural to *chain* operations. That is where the *pipe* operator comes in.




## The pipe `%>%`

![The R pipe is provided by `magrittr`](img/MagrittePipe.jpg){width=60%}

* In Unix, the *pipe* symbol `|` is used to pass data from one command to another, e.g. `ls | grep -v "#"`

>- In `magrittr`, the pipe `%>%` passes the output of its left-hand side to become the first argument of its right-hand side.


## The pipe `%>%`

![The pipe operator](img/R_pipe.png){width=70%}

&nbsp;

`filter(d, month==1) %>% select(dep_delay)`

## The pipe `%>%`

In R, special operators are often named with double `%` symbols. The *pipe* operator `%>%` is an example. 

&nbsp;

`t %>% f()` means precisely `f(t)`, i.e. the output of the LHS becomes the first argument of the RHS.

&nbsp;

It is useful to avoid complicated nested expressions:

&nbsp;

`t %>% f("abc") %>% g("x", "y")` is easier to read than 

&nbsp;

`g(f(t, "abc"), "x", "y")` 

&nbsp;

(isn't it?)






## Example: NYC Flights

```{r}
# uncomment if not already installed
# install.packages("nycflights13") 
library(nycflights13)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Take a quick look at data
```{r}
flights 
```

## `filter`
Let's see just flights on Jan 1:
```{r}
flights %>% filter(month == 1, day == 1) 
```

## `filter`
Remember, this is internally translated to:
```{r}
filter(flights, month == 1, day == 1) 
```

## `filter`
Which flight departure was delayed the longest? We can use `filter` again:
```{r}
flights %>% filter(dep_delay == max(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE))
```
Notice that `na.rm=TRUE` *inside* `max()` is essential: consider `max(flights$dep_delay)` to see why.

## Syntax notes
1. `na.rm` argument
2. We can refer to columns with no special syntax (not even quotes)
3. Remember `==` for equality (I put spaces), but `=` for passing keyword arguments (I don't put spaces, as in Python).

## `filter` examples

Boolean AND: use comma as we already saw
```{r}
flights %>% filter(month == 1, day == 1) 
```

## `filter` examples
Boolean OR: use |
```{r}
flights %>% filter(month == 1 | month == 12) 
```

## `filter` examples
`%in%` operator does the same as above:
```{r}
flights %>% filter(month %in% c(1, 12)) 
```

## `arrange`

`dplyr` becomes like a programmatic interface to Excel, e.g. sort-by-column:

```{r}
arrange(flights, dep_delay) # sort-by-column 
```


## `arrange`

Descending order:
```{r}
arrange(flights, desc(dep_delay)) 
```

## `select` chooses columns

```{r}
select(flights, day, month, year)
```
Notice that `select` also re-orders columns according to the arguments.

## `select` chooses columns
Select all columns from year to day (behind the scenes, the columns are *numbers*):
```{r}
select(flights, year:day) 
```

## Using `select` to deselect
```{r}
select(flights, -(month:minute))
```

(Note we can't mix positive and negative)

## More ways to select columns
```{r}
select(flights, starts_with("d"))
```

## `mutate`


```{r}
select(flights, year:day, ends_with("delay"), 
              distance, air_time) %>%
  mutate(gain=dep_delay - arr_delay) %>%
  mutate(speed=distance / air_time * 60)
```

## `mutate`
Remember none of these operations change the tibble itself, just return a new one. So we may decide to save the result in a new variable.

```{r}
sml <- select(flights, year:day, ends_with("delay"), 
              distance, air_time) %>%
  mutate(gain=dep_delay - arr_delay) %>%
  mutate(speed=distance / air_time * 60)
```


## `group_by`

![`group_by` illustration](img/R_groupby.png){width=75%}

(R4DS)

## `group_by` and `summarise` go well together

```{r}
group_by(flights, carrier) %>% 
  summarise(dep_delay=mean(dep_delay, na.rm=TRUE))
```

Compare to Pandas `pd.group_by`.





## A bigger example: `who`

`who` is a dataset from the World Health Organisation which needs a lot of cleaning:

&nbsp;

```{r}
who %>%
  # gather many columns to 1
  gather(key, value, new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, 
         na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  # fix inconsistent spelling
  mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel")) %>% 
  # split eg "new_sp_m014" -> "new", "sp", "m014"
  separate(key, c("new", "var", "sexage")) %>% 
  # remove redundant/unneeded columns
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>%  
  # split eg "m014" -> "m", "014"
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1) 
```

## A bigger example: `who`

See https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html for detailed explanation.

**Exercise**: look at the output of each step of this transformation, starting at `who` itself, to understand the need for the next.







## Some more handy functions (some from `dplyr`)

* Offset a vector of values: `lead` and `lag`
* Cumulative calculations: `cumsum`, `cummax`, etc.
* Where does each value come in a sort? `min_rank`
* Counts: `n`, `n_distinct`





## Functional programming in R

* `dplyr` and the pipe are already examples of functional programming! E.g. all these operations don't change their input, just return a new version.
* Our friend `map` also exists in R. It makes a list.
* `map_dbl` and friends may be more useful since they return `vector`s. Compare `map` and `map_dbl` in the following.

```
d = 1:5
# R uses the opposite argument ordering, compared to Python
map(d, sqrt) 
```

```
d = 1:5
map_dbl(d, sqrt) 
```

## Functional programming in R

```
d %>% map_dbl(sqrt) # equivalent, using pipe
```

## Functional programming in R

`map` and friends come from the `purrr` package, well-documented here: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions

## Summary

* tidy data: columns are variables, rows are observations
* tibbles
* pipe `%>%`
* verbs including `select`, `filter`, `mutate`, `arrange`, `rename`, `gather`, `spread`

Let's look at a cheatsheet for `dplyr`: 

https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf




## Exercises

* Exercise 1: Our sort times data is available in tidy format as `sort_times_tidy.csv`. Use `group_by` and `summarise` to get the mean and the standard deviation for each `n`, and then for each `run_number`. 

* A dataset of characters in *Star Wars* is available as `dplyr::starwars`. Exercise 2: Find all the human females. Exercise 3: Find the characters who are human *or* Wookiee. Exercise 4: Find the shortest character. Hint: recall we might need `na.rm`. Exercise 5: Add a new column called `BMI` giving the body mass index, where the formula is BMI = $m / h^2$ for mass $m$ in kg and height $h$ in metres. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index. Exercise 6: Which character has the highest BMI?

## Solutions

## Exercise 1

```{r}
d <- read_csv("data/sort_times_tidy.csv")
d %>% group_by(n) %>% summarise(mean_run_time=mean(run_time), sd_run_time=sd(run_time))
```

## Exercise 1

Notice that the mean and stddev for $n=7$ million are anomalously high. One way this could occur is if our computer had a spike in CPU usage during the experiment, e.g. due to a browser loading a video.

## Exercise 1
```{r}
d %>% group_by(run_number) %>% 
  summarise(mean_run_time=mean(run_time), 
            sd_run_time=sd(run_time))
```

No major anomalies this time.


## Exercise 2

```{r}
sw <- dplyr::starwars
sw %>% filter(species == "Human", gender == "female") # human females
```

## Exercise 3

```{r}
sw %>% filter(species == "Human" | species == "Wookiee") # human or Wookiee
sw %>% filter(species %in% c("Human", "Wookiee")) # alternative method
```

## Exercise 4

```{r}
sw %>% filter(height == max(height, na.rm=TRUE))
```


## Exercise 5
```{r}
# NB convert height from cm to metres before squaring
BMI <- function(h, m) {m / (h / 100)^2}
sw <- sw %>% mutate(bmi=BMI(height, mass))
```

## Exercise 6
```{r}
sw %>% filter(bmi == max(bmi, na.rm=TRUE))
```
