**Introduction to R**

## R

R is a language for statistical computing. It is based on an older, commercial language S. Like most of the software studied in this MSc, R is open-source. Research statisticians develop new algorithms in R because it is high-quality open-source. Professional data scientists use it because many statistical algorithms become available in R first, and because the ecosystem, especially tools like RStudio, R Markdown, ggplot, the tidyverse, and Shiny, are excellent.

## R Ecosystem

* RStudio: a nice IDE for R
* R Markdown: a text-based format for writing reports with integrated R code, code outputs, and plots
* ggplot: best-in-class plotting
* The tidyverse: a collection of packages for manipulating data according to rational principles of "tidy data"
* Shiny: web-based dashboards

## Sources

* Our R lessons are based partly on Hadley Wickham's *R for Data Science* https://r4ds.had.co.nz

* We also draw on Dr Jim Duggan's NUI Galway module CT474

* The materials are written in "R Markdown". I'll distribute both the `.Rmd` source and the `.pdf` slide output. https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-1.html
