**Statistics in R**

## Load Tidyverse as usual
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Random numbers

```{r}
x1 <- runif(20, min=0, max=2) # random uniform with bounds
x2 <- rnorm(20) # random normal with mean 0, sd 1
y <- x1 + x2 * rnorm(20, mean=5, sd=2) 
ggplot(tibble(y), aes(x=y)) + geom_density()
```

## Basic statistics

```{r}
for (f in c(min, max, mean, median, sd, var, IQR, mad)) {
  print(f(y))
}
```

## More data summaries

```{r}
for (f in c(range, quantile, summary, fivenum)) {
  print(f(y))
}
```

## Correlations

```{r}
cor(x1, y) # get the correlation
```

## Correlations: statistical test
```{r}
cor.test(x1, y) # run a test
```

## Correlations: using results
```{r}
res = cor.test(x1, y) # save the result
names(res) # see result structure
R = res['statistic'] # extract values...
p = res['p.value'] # ...from the result
```


## Null hypothesis significance testing


## Independent 2-sample 2-sided t-test

Test whether difference in means is different from 0

```{r}
t.test(x1, y) 
```

## More t-tests

The `t.test` function also has options for:

* 1-sided tests
* paired tests
* 1-sample tests.




## Regression models

The `lm` (linear model) function and variants are used for regression.

```{r}
df = tibble(x1, x2, y)
head(df)
```


## Formulas

R provides a special formula syntax involving the tilde `~`. It's used to specify a regression model. The left-hand side is the dependent variable, `y`. The right-hand side gives the independent variables, interactions, and transformations. So, `~` means something like "is modelled as".

```
y ~ x1 + x2
```

This says: run the formula $y = a + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2$

## Using a formula in a regression

```{r}
res <- lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data=df) 
summary(res) # show results
```

## Formulas with interaction

If we changed `+` to `*`, we would add the interaction effect, ie we would run the formula

$y = a + b_1 x_1 + b_2 x_2 + b_{12} x_1 x_2$

Use `?formula` for more on this special syntax.


## Formulas with interaction

```{r}
res <- lm(y ~ x1 * x2, data=df) 
summary(res) # show results
```



## Formulas with transformation
We could also use transformations. For example:
```{r}
res <- lm(y ~ x1 + log(x2), data=df) 
summary(res) # show results
```




## One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)

Like t-test for multiple groups, again using a formula.
```{r}
res = aov(height ~ gender * species, data=dplyr::starwars)
summary(res)
```



## Beyond Base R: the `caret` package

* k-nearest neighbours
* Linear regression
* Support vector machines
* Classification/regression trees
* Perceptrons
* Ensembles, including forests, bagging, boosting

## The `caret` package

The main Python competitor is `scikit-learn` which we will study later.

We won't go into detail on ML algorithms in this class.

## Exercises

1. In the `mpg` dataset (part of the tidyverse), calculate the mean and standard deviation of the highway fuel efficiency.
2. Using `group_by`, calculate the mean and standard deviation of the highway fuel efficiency per manufacturer.
3. Calculate the correlation between highway fuel efficiency and engine size.
4. What was the average highway fuel efficiency in 1999 and in 2008?
5. Carry out a two-sample independent t-test between highway fuel efficiency in 1999 and 2008 and interpret the result.
6. Carry out a regression on highway fuel efficency by displacement.

## Solution 1
library(tidyverse)

```{r}
mean(mpg$hwy)
sd(mpg$hwy)
```

## Solution 2
```{r}
mpg %>% group_by(manufacturer) %>% 
  summarise(mean=mean(hwy), sd=sd(hwy))
```

## Solution 3

```{r}
cor(mpg$hwy, mpg$displ)
```

## Solution 4
```{r}
mpg %>% group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise(mean=mean(hwy), sd=sd(hwy))
```

## Solution 5
```{r}
mpg1999 <- mpg %>% filter(year == 1999)
mpg2008 <- mpg %>% filter(year == 2008)
t.test(mpg1999$hwy, mpg2008$hwy)
```

## Solution 6

```{r}
res = lm(hwy ~ displ, data=mpg)
summary(res)
```
